    The Kyoto Protocols
    </h1>
    <p class="p">
    The Kyoto Protocol was set to reduce the emissions of six greenhouse gasses, 
    which contribute to climate change, in 41 countries plus the EU to 5.2% below 
    1990 levels within the Commitment Period 2008-2012.

    Treaty Extension And Replacement
    </h1>
    <p class="p">
    At the 18th conference, held in Doha, Qatar on the 8th of december 2012,
    delegates agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020. They also reaffirmed their pledge of the 17th conference, which was held in Durban, South Africa in 2011 to create a new, thorough, legally binding climate treaty by 2015 that would require greenhouse gas producing countries to limit and decrease the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. A new treaty,
    implemented in 2020, would fully replace the Kyoto Protocol.

    Looking Back From Today
    </h1>
    <p class="p">
    The Kyoto Protocol was limited in its success because of lack of worldwide support and it did not encompass large and fast growing economies; it excluded developing countries from binding targets and unfortunately, the United States of America failed to participate.
